Here I should type some relevant infomations about myself...  

So I'm passionate about micro services architectures, containers and orchestration of those.  
I like automating most of tedious tasks when it comes to development of these types of systems as well.  
My motto is to always keep it simple.

I suppose redirecting to Github now might be the good thing to do so you could check out what's up for me.
